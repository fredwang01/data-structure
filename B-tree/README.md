First of all, the code is from https://cis.stvincent.edu/html/tutorials/swd/btree/btree.html.

NOTE:
This is only a demonstration to learn B-tree, it is simple, some tips about it:
1) Only include B-tree node insert, without delete.
2) Store every B-tree node in a file. in most cases, we should cache some top B-tree nodes considering performence.

The branch 1.0 is the original code, but I enable the DEBUG macro on the master branch and add some debug code in order to investigate the B-tree file with convenience.
